        Spotify provides a Top Tracks listing, which monitors what people are listening to within Spotify - think of it
        as
        an alternative to the Billboard Hot 100. The popularity bar that appears next
        to all Spotify tracks is a meter that measures how frequently a track is being listened to the more people are
        listening to it, the higher the meter goes.
